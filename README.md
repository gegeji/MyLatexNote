# MyLatexNote
This is my modified LaTeX note and I use it for my English class.

## Usage

Compile it using XeLaTex - makeindex - biber - XeLaTex*2.
You may need to adjust the setting of fonts in structure.tex.

## Base Template

This project is modified based on [The Legrand Orange Book](https://www.latextemplates.com/template/the-legrand-orange-book).
